## Part C: Gathering data from social media
This part of the assignment should be done using the Jupyter interface, through Anaconda development software. This software will allow you to use Python codes in a web interface, helping you to visualize your results and replicate others' easily.

**Step 1:** Download the Anaconda from the website https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Hopefully it will show the platform of your PC.

The next screens are for Windows platform (from the lab where you are seated).

**Step 2:** after download, click at the Run button on the bottom of your web brower.

**Step 3:** Next-Next-Next

**Step 4:** if everything went fine, click Finish and unckeck the box (unless you are interested on learning more about Anaconda Cloud)

**Step 5:** open the **Anaconda Navigator** software.

**Step 6:** The Anaconda interface might look like the figure below. Here you have the notebook platform, and you can Lauch it.

**Step 7:** after a terminal (or console) shows some stuff happening (don't close it!), your web browser may show the following screen, with your files explorer.

Good! You are ready to start. You can create a new Notebook, but we are gonna use my own notebook. So go to BB and download the file Part_C.zip and download it at your computer. There you can find the file Assignment5_Part_C.ipynb.

**Step 8:** open the ipynb file using Jupyter interface, and have fun!

## Belangrijk!

At the end of the activities with the notebook, you should save your own notebook as PDF and send it together with the other files from the previous parts.
